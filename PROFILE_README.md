## 🚀 Why Mẹ? The 10-Second Pitch for Recruiters

I am a product-minded **Full-Stack Engineer** who builds **production-grade**, scalable systems rather than just "toy projects." I deeply understand both the technical complexities (microservices, WebSockets, Kafka, caching) and the business constraints (costs, user experience, latency). 

*   **System Design & Backend:** I build resilient systems. (e.g., A microservices job platform using Kafka/Redis, and a from-scratch OAuth2/OIDC centralized auth server).
*   **Frontend & UX:** I obsess over details, creating pixel-perfect, highly animated UIs in React/Next.js with custom Frame Motion and Tailwind setups.
*   **Problem Solver:** Top 95th percentile in JEE Mains (~1M candidates) and 400+ LeetCode problems solved. I thrive on complex algorithmic and architectural challenges.

## 🌟 Featured Engineering Projects

### 1. WorkWizard - Intelligent AI Job Platform
*A production-grade microservices job board connecting seekers and recruiters.*
* **Tech:** Next.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, Razorpay, Gemini AI.
* **Architecture Highlights:** Designed as domain-driven microservices (Auth, Jobs, Users, Payments). Implemented a **Kafka producer-consumer pipeline** to decouple email delivery from the request lifecycle, ensuring high reliability.
* **Business Logic:** Integrated Razorpay for subscription-based candidate prioritization and Gemini AI for automated ATS scoring and career path recommendation.

### 2. AegisID - Centralized Auth Service
*A secure identity platform implementing OAuth2 and OpenID Connect from scratch.*
* **Tech:** Node.js, Redis, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Docker.
* **Security & Performance:** Reduced database load by ~40% utilizing **Redis caching** for ephemeral auth state and token verification.
* **Features:** Implemented JWT access and refresh token rotation with revocation, strict session handling, and RS256 cryptographic signing. Dockerized for immediate CI/CD deployment.

### 3. Real-Time Collaborative Whiteboard
*A low-latency collaborative canvas with conflict-aware editing sessions.*
* **Tech:** React, WebSockets, TypeScript.
* **Engineering Challenge:** Overcoming simultaneous state mutation (conflict resolution) and modeling a scalable shared undo/redo stack utilizing strict typed event contracts over WebSockets.

## 📈 Metrics That Matter

*   **Algorithms:** Competitively solve complex problems iteratively (400+ LeetCode Solutions).
*   **Scale:** My personal projects are not single monoliths; they follow industry-standard distributed systems patterns (incorporating load balancing, API gateways, and asynchronous message queues).
*   **Execution:** I take projects from an idea to a fully deployed cloud infrastructure with continuous integration.

## 💡 What I Bring to Your Team

1.  **Extreme Ownership:** I take features from initial system design diagrams all the way to frontend pixels and database migrations.
2.  **Product Intuition:** I don't just write code; I think about how the user interacts with the product and how business logic (like AI token costs or DB queries) scales.
3.  **Fast Learner:** Capable of picking up legacy codebases or cutting-edge frameworks (e.g., Turbopack, Gemini APIs) very quickly.
